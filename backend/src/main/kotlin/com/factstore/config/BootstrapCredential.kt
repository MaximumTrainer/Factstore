/**
 * First-run bootstrap (#155 FR-7).
 *
 * A fresh deployment with enforcement on has to be usable: otherwise there is no way to
 * authenticate, and therefore no way to create the credential that would let you authenticate.
 * Starting an unusable service and leaving the operator to discover it is the worst of the
 * options, so this either creates a bootstrap admin credential or fails fast with an
 * actionable message.
 *
 * The credential is written to the log **once**, at startup, with instructions to rotate it.
 * That is a deliberate trade: a secret in a startup log is not ideal, but it is visible,
 * short-lived by TTL, and far better than a well-known default.
