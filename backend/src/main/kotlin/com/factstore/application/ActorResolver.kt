/**
 * Resolves the actor to attribute an audit event to (#156 FR-7).
 *
 * "Who did this" is a question a compliance product has to answer, so an audit event naming
 * `system` for something a person did is a defect, not a detail. This reads whatever principal
 * the authentication filters put on the security context:
 *
 *  - a signed-in person → their email;
 *  - an API key → `api-key:<owner id>`, so the key's owner is on the record too;
 *  - nothing → `system`, which is then genuinely true: an unauthenticated or internal action.
