# Part 1: Overview

Factstore is a software supply chain traceability platform. It gives your engineering organisation a tamper-evident record of every artefact you build, every quality gate you pass, and every deployment you make — so you can answer compliance questions with evidence rather than guesswork.

## How this guide is structured

This guide walks you through every concept in Factstore from the ground up, in the same order you would set things up for a real delivery pipeline:

You can read this guide linearly or jump to the section you need.

## Core concepts

### Flow

A **Flow** represents a repeatable software delivery process — for example, the CI/CD pipeline that builds and ships your backend service. A Flow defines the compliance requirements that every execution of that process must satisfy (e.g. "unit tests must pass", "a security scan must be attached").

### Trail

A **Trail** is a single execution of a Flow. Each time your CI pipeline runs — triggered by a commit, a pull request, or a ticket — you create a Trail to record everything that happened during that run.

### Artifact

An **Artifact** is a versioned, immutable build output: a Docker image, a JAR file, a binary. Factstore identifies artifacts by their **SHA-256 digest**, so the record is tied to the exact bytes — not just a name or tag.

### Attestation

An **Attestation** is a piece of evidence that a quality gate was completed. Examples include: JUnit test results, a Snyk security scan report, a pull-request review, or a Jira ticket link. Attestations are append-only and immutable once recorded.

### Compliance assertion

At any point you can ask Factstore: *"Is this artifact compliant with this Flow's requirements?"* The `POST /api/v1/assert` endpoint evaluates the attestations on a Trail against the Flow's required attestation types and returns a compliance verdict.

## How Factstore relates to Kosli

Factstore is intentionally modelled after [Kosli](https://docs.kosli.com), sharing the same core concepts of Flows, Trails, Artifacts, Attestations, Environments, Policies, and Approvals. The key difference today is that Factstore exposes a **REST API** rather than a CLI — every operation is a plain HTTP call.
