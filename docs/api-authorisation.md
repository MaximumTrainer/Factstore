# API authentication and authorisation

Machine access to the OpenFactstore API: how a credential is presented, what it may do, and
how it is managed.

Human sign-in is documented in [authentication.md](./authentication.md). Both resolve into the
**same role model**, described there.

---

## Presenting a credential

`Authorization: Bearer <key>` is the documented scheme for all clients.

| Scheme | Status |
|---|---|
| `Authorization: Bearer <key>` | **Recommended** |
| `X-API-Key: <key>` | Supported |
| `Authorization: ApiKey <key>` | Deprecated. Still accepted; logged as deprecated by key **prefix** only |

A key looks like `fsp_<64 hex>` (user-owned) or `fss_<64 hex>` (service account).

### When a credential is refused

A malformed, unknown, expired or revoked credential is rejected **immediately** with `401`,
`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="factstore"`, and a problem body:

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "reason": "EXPIRED",
  "message": "The credential has expired",
  "credentialPrefix": "fss_a1b2c3d"
}
```

`reason` is one of `MISSING`, `MALFORMED`, `UNKNOWN`, `EXPIRED`, `REVOKED`. The messages
deliberately do **not** distinguish "no such key" from "wrong key", so a caller cannot use the
response to discover whether a key exists. Only the **prefix** is echoed — enough to identify
which credential failed, never enough to use it.

> **What this replaced.** The filter used to validate a key and, on failure, fall through and
> let the route decide. A wrong key therefore looked exactly like no key at all — and with
> enforcement off, like success.

### Rate limiting

Failed authentication backs off exponentially, counted separately **per source address and per
credential prefix**, returning `429` with `Retry-After`. A successful authentication clears the
counters, so a pipeline that fixes its credential is not left locked out.

Counting both ways is deliberate: one misconfigured runner should not lock out a whole NAT, and
one stolen prefix should not be rescued by rotating source addresses.

## Scopes

A key carries `resource:action` scopes, and its authorities are derived from them.

| Scope | Allows |
|---|---|
| `flows:read` / `flows:write` | Read / create, edit, archive, delete flows |
| `trails:read` / `trails:write` | Read / create trails |
| `attestations:write` | Record attestations — **the CI-pipeline scope** |
| `artifacts:write` | Register artifacts |
| `evidence:read` / `evidence:write` | Read / upload evidence |
| `assert:execute` | Run compliance assertions |
| `policies:read` / `policies:write` | Read / upload and delete policies |
| `approvals:write` | Grant approvals |
| `admin` | Key management, service accounts, organisation and SSO configuration |

`GET /api/v1/api-keys/scopes` returns this vocabulary and the presets, so a client need not
hard-code it.

### Presets

| Preset | Scopes |
|---|---|
| `CI_PIPELINE` | `trails:write`, `attestations:write`, `artifacts:write`, `evidence:write`, `assert:execute` |
| `READ_ONLY` | `flows:read`, `trails:read` |

**A key created without scopes gets `READ_ONLY`, not full access.** That is the whole point:

> **What this replaced.** Every valid key granted exactly one authority, `ROLE_API_USER`,
> regardless of owner or purpose. A CI key that only needed to post attestations could delete
> flows, mint further keys, and read every organisation's evidence.

### No privilege escalation

A caller may only grant scopes it holds itself; requesting more is `403`. A caller holding
`admin` may grant anything. An unauthenticated caller — possible while enforcement is off — may
create only a read-only key.

## The authorisation matrix

| Operation | Requires |
|---|---|
| Read flows, trails, attestations, evidence, reports, audit log | a read scope |
| Create trails, attestations, artifacts; run assertions; upload evidence | the matching write scope |
| Create / edit / archive / delete / rename a flow | `flows:write` |
| Upload, edit or delete a policy | `policies:write` |
| Manage organisation members | `admin` |
| Manage service accounts and their keys | `admin` |
| Create, rotate or revoke an API key | `admin` |
| Configure SSO | `admin` |
| List or revoke another user's sessions | `admin` |

`EndpointAuthorisationMatrixTest` checks this against the annotations, so the table and the code
cannot drift: an endpoint on a matrixed controller either carries an `@PreAuthorize` requiring
the documented scope, or appears in an explicit allowlist with a stated reason. It also fails on
a **stale** allowlist entry, which is how an exemption outlives the endpoint it was written for
and starts silently covering a new one.

> Policy deletion previously required `hasAnyRole('ADMIN', 'MEMBER', 'API_USER')` — which let a
> `MEMBER` and *any* API key delete a policy. The check found it.

## Managing keys

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/api-keys` | Create. Plain text returned **once** |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/api-keys/{id}/rotate` | Rotate, with an overlap window |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/api-keys/owners/{ownerId}` | List (never returns key material) |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/api-keys/scopes` | The scope vocabulary and presets |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/api-keys/{id}/revoke` | Revoke |

```http
POST /api/v1/api-keys
{
  "ownerId": "uuid",
  "ownerType": "SERVICE_ACCOUNT",
  "label": "GitHub Actions — payments",
  "preset": "CI_PIPELINE",
  "orgSlug": "acme",
  "ttlDays": 90
}
```

### TTL

A maximum TTL is enforced at creation (`security.api-key.max-ttl-days`, default 90), and
**omitting `ttlDays` uses the default rather than creating a key that never expires**. A
non-expiring key requires `neverExpires: true` *and*
`security.api-key.allow-non-expiring=true`, and is logged as the explicit override it is.

A key within `security.api-key.expiry-warning-days` (default 7) of expiry is flagged on the key
resource (`expiringSoon`, `daysUntilExpiry`) **and** on every response to a request made with
it, via `X-Factstore-Credential-Warning` — so a pipeline hears about it before it breaks.

### Rotation

```http
POST /api/v1/api-keys/{id}/rotate
{ "overlapHours": 24 }
```

Returns a replacement with the same scopes and organisation. **The previous key keeps working
until the overlap window closes**, so a pipeline can pick up the new value on its next run
rather than failing on its next call. Both keys work during the window; the old one then stops.

### Revocation

Effective on the **next request**. Successful validations are cached briefly
(`security.api-key.cache-ttl-seconds`, default 60) to avoid a BCrypt comparison per call —
tens of milliseconds of CPU each, which for a pipeline in a loop is the dominant cost of the
request — but revoking a key drops its cached entries immediately, and the key row is
re-checked even on a cache hit. The cache is keyed on a SHA-256 of the credential, never the
credential itself.

---

## Tenant binding

A key can be bound to one organisation (`orgSlug`). It authenticates *into* that organisation,
and the binding travels with the request for scoping.

A resource belonging to another organisation returns **`404`, not `403`** — a `403` confirms the
resource exists, which is enough to enumerate another tenant's data.

---

## First run

A fresh deployment with `SECURITY_ENFORCE_AUTH=true` and no admin credential cannot be
administered — there would be no way to authenticate in order to create the credential that
would let you authenticate. So on first start OpenFactstore creates a **bootstrap admin key**
and writes it to the log once, with instructions to rotate it:

```
================ OpenFactstore bootstrap credential ================
   key:     fsp_…
   expires: 7 days
```

A secret in a startup log is not ideal. It is visible, short-lived, and much better than a
well-known default. Use it to create your real admin identity, revoke it, and set
`security.bootstrap.enabled=false`.

With bootstrapping disabled, enforcement on, and no admin credential, the application **fails
to start** with an actionable message rather than starting an unusable service.

---

## Rolling out enforcement

`security.enforce-auth` still defaults to **`false`**, deliberately, following the rollout in
#155 §5: scopes, the matrix, rotation and auditing ship first, then warn mode, and the default
flips in a clearly marked release.

### Warn mode

```yaml
security:
  warn-mode: true
```

Authenticate and authorise as normal, but on failure **log what would have been rejected and
allow the request**. This is how you find every unauthenticated caller before switching over,
instead of discovering them as an outage.

### Then

```yaml
security:
  enforce-auth: true
```

Which also:

- restricts `/actuator/**` to health and info (metrics, env and loggers require a credential);
- stops serving Swagger UI, `/api-docs` and the H2 console unauthenticated;
- sets HSTS;
- refuses a wildcard CORS origin outright.

Roll back with `SECURITY_ENFORCE_AUTH=false`.

## Auditing

| Event | Recorded |
|---|---|
| `AUTH_FAILED` | Reason, credential **prefix**, source IP, method, path |
| `API_KEY_CREATED` | Actor, key prefix, owner, scopes, TTL |
| `API_KEY_ROTATED` | Actor, both key ids, when the old key stops working |
| `API_KEY_REVOKED` | Actor, key prefix, owner |

**No audit entry or log line contains key material** — only the 12-character prefix. An audit
log that contains working credentials is a liability, not a control, and there is a test
asserting a created key's secret appears in no audit payload.

---

| `security.cors.allowed-origins` | *(none)* | Comma-separated allowlist. Deny by default |

---

## Recommended setup for a pipeline

One **service account and one key per pipeline**, scoped `CI_PIPELINE`, bound to the
organisation, with a TTL and a rotation schedule. Then a leaked key is bounded in what it can
do, whose it is, and how long it lasts — which is the entire point of scoping.

See [ci-integration.md](./ci-integration.md) for the pipeline patterns.
